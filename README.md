# HoneyPie Wallpaper Engine

A lightweight video wallpaper engine for Windows that allows you to set videos as your desktop background.

## About

This is my first programming project using C, created by AloNeXe. I wanted to make something useful and fun, so I created HoneyPie - a simple but effective wallpaper engine that lets you use videos as your desktop background. While there are other wallpaper engines out there, I wanted to create something lightweight and easy to use. And this inspired by

The name "HoneyPie" comes from my love for simple and sweet solutions. Just like honey, this app aims to make your desktop experience smoother and more enjoyable.
